Food Delivery System (Website)

<i><b>*Note:</b> Currently are using html with external css + internal css (abit) in this website.</i>
<br>
<i><b>*Note:</b> The login.css used in most of the likely html... Seems have to separate them but dunno will increase the redundancy.</i>
<br>
<i><b>*Note:</b> Most of the pages used navigation + footer (all pages XD), which think to separate them and reuse it...</i>
