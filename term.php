<h3>Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Additional functionality is available to users subscribing for a Snippet PRO account. A free plan may continue to be available with limited functionality. The functionality available in the free plan may be reduced in the future. Depending on your usage of the Service, this may require you to upgrade to a paid plan in the future in order to continue using the Service at the same capacity.
<br>
Some parts of the Service (Snippet PRO) are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
<br>
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or MOVALIO MEDIA SRL cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting MOVALIO MEDIA SRL customer support team.
<br>
A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide MOVALIO MEDIA SRL with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize MOVALIO MEDIA SRL to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
<br>
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, MOVALIO MEDIA SRL will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<h3>Fee Changes</h3>
<p>MOVALIO MEDIA SRL, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
<br>
MOVALIO MEDIA SRL will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
<br>
Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

<h3>Refunds</h3>
<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by MOVALIO MEDIA SRL on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of MOVALIO MEDIA SRL.
<br>
In order to be valid, refund requests must be received within 3 business days after you have started your PRO account subscription.
<br>
The amount we refund to you will not include payment processing fees associated with your original payment.</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
<br>
Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>

<h3>Limitation Of Liability</h3>
<p>In no event shall MOVALIO MEDIA SRL, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
